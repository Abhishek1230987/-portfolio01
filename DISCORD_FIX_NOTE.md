# Discord Messaging Fix - July 14, 2025

## Issue Resolved
Fixed Discord webhook messaging functionality in the contact form system.

## Problem
- Telegram messaging was working correctly
- Discord webhook was failing when called through the API endpoint
- Direct Discord webhook tests were successful

## Root Cause
The issue was related to server process management and environment loading. The Discord webhook functionality was working correctly at the code level, but had transient runtime issues.

## Solution Applied
1. **Process Restart**: Restarted the backend server with proper process management
2. **Environment Verification**: Confirmed all environment variables were correctly loaded
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Verified both Discord and Telegram messaging work correctly

## Current Status
✅ **Discord Messaging**: Fully functional
✅ **Telegram Messaging**: Fully functional
✅ **API Endpoint**: Working correctly
✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error reporting in place

## Configuration
Both platforms are configured in `backend/.env`:
- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`: Discord webhook URL
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Telegram bot token  
- `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`: Telegram chat ID

## Testing
Run the following commands to test the functionality:
```bash
cd backend
node test-discord.js    # Test Discord webhook
node test-telegram.js   # Test Telegram bot
node test-api.js        # Test complete API endpoint
```

## Deployment Notes
- The fix was applied at runtime level, no code changes were required
- All existing functionality remains intact
- Both messaging platforms now work reliably
